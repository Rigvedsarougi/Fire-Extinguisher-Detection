# Fire Detection App

This is a **Fire Detection App** that utilizes YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to detect fire in images, videos, and live streams. The app is built using **Streamlit** for a seamless and interactive user experience.

## Features

- **Image Detection:** Upload an image and detect fire regions.
- **Video Detection:** Upload a video file for fire detection frame by frame.
- **Live Detection:** Perform real-time fire detection using your webcam or a live video feed.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for training and deploying YOLOv5.
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision library for image and video processing.
- **Streamlit**: Web framework for creating interactive applications.
- **YOLOv5**: Pre-trained object detection model.
